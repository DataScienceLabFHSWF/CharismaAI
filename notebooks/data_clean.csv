215,"Speaker 4    00:24:09    Thank you, Secretary Freelander and Governor Bashier.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
216,"Um, as the governor talked, these decisions that weve had to make, the recommendations Ive had to make, uh, to the governor and the decisions Ive had to participate in, uh, have not been easy.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
217,"Um, since we started this journey, theres been a difficult balancing act between what we know and what we dont know and the consequences we know and the consequences we dont, you know, were, were facing an infection that we cant see.",,,,,1.0,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
218,"Um, its an invisible enemy, as I think the governor has already said here tonight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
219,"Um, people seldom give much credit for things in harms you prevent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
220,"Uh, but they know that the harms theyve experienced, and weve experienced harms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
221,"Some of us have lost loved ones and family members, uh, others have had loved ones or family members in the hospital, and theyve, um, had endured the difficulties of having a critically ill or a seriously ill family member or loved one that they cant even visit in a hospital.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
222,Speaker 4    00:25:10    Because the need to protect the greater public has required us to take these steps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
223,"And of course, the economic carnage that this has wrought is not just unique to this state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
224,"Its this state, its the country and its international.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
225,"So there is no doubt that this, uh, infection has taken a horrible toll on humanity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
226,"And unfortunately, it will continue to take a toll until we find a vaccine and a way to prevent this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
227,"Or until we find a treatment where we can cure it, were left with old school, old fashioned public health measures, which we know work, but, but are difficult to implement because they require us to make sacrifices, sacrifices that protect us and the people we love and care about, but also sacrifices that protect other people who rely on us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
228,"So you see us all walk up here with these masks, and Im gonna tell you I dont like it anymore in anyone else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
229,Speaker 4    00:26:06    It fogs my glasses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
230,"Its uncomfortable, its hard to breathe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
231,Nobody likes wearing these.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
232,"Its important that we wear these, and Im gonna show a video here in a minute.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
233,"I think weve, weve got the, when Im ready, write James.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
234,"So weve got a video and its not, I mean, Im not here to guilt trip or single out specific groups or people or, or entities, but I think we have to show what happens when were relying on people to do the right thing when we dont, uh, follow the, the, the directions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
235,The evidence is absolutely overwhelmingly clearer that a small number of large events or a small number of a lot of people getting together with one or two infected folks spreads this thing like wildfire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
236,Weve seen it at conventions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
237,There were conferences that was in Boston.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
238,Weve seen it at events where people get together for religious ceremonies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
239,Speaker 4    00:27:05    Weve seen it when people get together for gatherings around the world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
240,"And this goes, this is true for where we are today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
241,"It is true when we had the Spanish flu in 1918, and thats the slide that the governor has showed repeatedly for the Philadelphia versus St.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
242,Louis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
243,They threw a big parade in Philadelphia and they paid a horrible price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
244,We know these things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
245,Historys taught us these things and we see it happening in real time now around the world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
246,So Im gonna show you a little video clip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
247,"I may not make you watch it all, but I said this when I, when I spoke last week at the press conferences, I said it when I did my k e t interview for, uh, the Coronavirus update.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
248,"I was concerned that people would get out, would get close together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
249,"Look, we want to see each other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
250,Speaker 4    00:27:56    We wanna spend time with each other.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
251,I get that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
252,"But the clip Im about to show, which happened in Kentucky, which is on social media, is actually a small example of some of the bigger things that I know youve seen in the media.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
253,"People at huge water parks, people all getting together as if there is not this infection out there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
254,And I dont know what itll take for us to learn it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
255,"This is not a game, this is serious.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
256,"But Im gonna have you watch just a minute of this and see, this is what happened at a bar over the weekend in Kentucky.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
257,Weve got people all together  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
258,Speaker 6    00:28:39    Of those  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
259,Speaker 4    00:28:39    Same family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
260,Theyre clearly not all the same household together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
261,"Speaker 4    00:28:43    You get together like this, you get one person who walks through there with an infection talking loud, not even looking sick, talking loud and spraying spit and saliva.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
262,Cuz thats what we do when we talk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
263,"As gross as that sounds, thats what happens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
264,People shouting to be heard over the music.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
265,Thats how you spread this infection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
266,"And before you know it, that fun evening out turns into two weeks later, 40 or 50 people sick who went out and spread the envi further or the virus further and spread it further.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
267,"And so I, you know, I carry folders around here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
268,"Sometimes the contents varies from day to day, but in it today is information on the long term care situation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
269,"The secretary told you we had to mass evacuate 37 people from a nursing home over four hours into six different hospitals any other time thats front page news, because you wouldnt have that unless a chlorine tanker dumped over on a railroad and you had a chemical crisis, or you had some major catastrophe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
270,"Speaker 4    00:29:46    And you know what, its the biggest one weve done for an evacuation from a nursing home, but its not the only.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
271,So we had to evacuate 19 people from a different nursing home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
272,"And over a month ago, weve had to do this in smaller levels, ac in cities across the state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
273,So thats unfolding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
274,"The, um, Secretary Browns been up here and talked about Green River Corrections and all the efforts we had to do at a prison to try to contain things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
275,"And at the Federal Medical Center, we have an outbreak underway as we speak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
276,"Um, we have, I have another report in here where were tracking a whole sheet full of employers, faculty, or factories, plants, um, all sorts of employers where there are cases, all of which could turn into a major outbreak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
277,"So I know its a beautiful day out, not right now, it got cloudy, but I know theres beautiful weather out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
278,Speaker 4    00:30:39    Its springtime.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
279,"People want to be with each other, But Im just telling you, this is out there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
280,Its all over Kentucky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
281,And the virus is just waiting to get us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
282,And we know what we have to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
283,"We have to stay away from each other and, and appreciate and respect and care about each other and do a simple act like wearing a mask and social distancing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
284,"But if we dont do these things, were all gonna pay a price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
285,"And, and I, I hope youve, youve seen over the months that youve gotten to know me a bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
286,Im not sensational.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
287,Im not trying to be sensational about this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
288,Its real.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
289,"And if, if people dont believe that, you just gotta look at social media and just read the news a little bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
290,"So I want to focus on, as I end on the positive, I still get letters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
291,"Speaker 4    00:31:20    I got some today for people expressing gratitude, saying thank you for what weve done.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
292,"I, I am very privileged to work with and for Governor Bashier because these decisions have been hard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
293,These are things that weigh heavy on all of us who have to make em.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
294,We know the sacrifices they entail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
295,"But if we didnt do this stuff, instead of standing here today and telling you bad news, about 400 people being dead, every single model, every single prediction we had wouldve had us standing up here and having our own version, version of the front page of the New York Times, talking about how a hundred thousand Americans have died this year alone from a disease that didnt exist until this year in the United States.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
296,So please do the right thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
297,Care for others and dont criticize others.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
298,"If you choose not to wear these things, dont criticize the people who do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
299,"And if others arent wearing them, dont pick a fight with other folks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
300,"Just steer a path and walk away, Let others do what theyre gonna do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
301,But you can protect yourself if you follow the guidance were giving you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
302,"So thank you very much, Governor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
303,Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
304,Speaker 2    00:32:30    All right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
305,"So, um, most of the time I think I play bad Cop and Dr. Stack plays good cop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
306,"Uh, and I wholeheartedly agree with absolutely everything he just said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
307,"Weve had a couple of examples, and its only a couple that weve seen thus far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
308,Like what you saw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
309,We cant have one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
310,Thats the challenge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
311,"Everybodys decisions, every single person counts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
312,"And just one person making wrong decisions or one bar allowing wrong things to occur can spread this, uh, virus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
313,"And, and Ill say what he wont, I wouldnt go there and I wont go there, and you shouldnt either, because if were not gonna enforce social distancing at places, theyre not safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
314,"Uh, but the good news is we continue, uh, to be, uh, at a time that we want to keep going, uh, where it appears that we are in a decline of our, even our total number of cases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
315,Speaker 2    00:33:27    And thats even with significantly more testing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
316,"So today, Im reporting on the last three days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
317,"And over the last three days, uh, we have had 387 new cases of the Coronavirus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
318,"But let me break that down on the 24th, 141 new cases on the 25th, 122 new cases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
319,"And on the 26th, 117 new cases, some of the lowest numbers that we have seen, um, again and, and holding there each day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
320,"Now, labs were closed a couple of these days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
321,"We wanna see tomorrow what we have likely tomorrow will be a lot higher and, but well average out, uh, over those three days in a way that again, shows that, that we are on the decline, but thats fragile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
322,"And with a disease that can so easily spread, we have to want and, and, uh, put into action, uh, our desire to continue to see that downward movement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
323,"Speaker 2    00:34:28    Uh, so those 387 tests after duplicates have been removed, takes our total case number to 8,951.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
324,"8,951.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
325,150.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
326,"One of those are probable, and the rest are lab confirmed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
327,"And thats out of a total number of tests now of 193,576, though I believe for the first time, some of the serology numbers are in there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
328,So were gonna break that out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
329,But I wanna make sure that we have those numbers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
330,"Uh, exactly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
331,"Uh, theres been some problems with the serology numbers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
332,"So I believe the best thing that we can do is to break it down so everybody can see, uh, where they all fall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333,"Uh, total number ho uh, hospitalized, both hospital numbers and ICUs today are based on imperfect data, uh, because not all the hospitals reported over this long weekend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
334,"So the numbers we have subject to change tomorrow are total number ever hospitalized, 2,136, currently 489, uh, ever in the icu, 897, currently 78.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
335,"Speaker 2    00:35:34    And I hope thats accurate, though not all hospitals have reported, because wed love to see that being a low number.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
336,"And the current number recovered 3,115 new cases by County 146 in Jefferson, 41 in Shelby, 30 in Warren, 26 in Fayette, 10 in Kenton, and Logan, nine in Allen, eight in Ohio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
337,"Uh, Ill slow down Virginia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
338,"Seven in Butler, six in Henderson, five in Boone, Oldham and Simpson.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
339,Four in Henry and Justin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
340,"Three in Clay Davis, Grant Grayson and Muhlenberg.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
341,"Two in Boyle, Campbell, Edmondson, Madison, McCracken and McClain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
342,"And one in Ballard, Baron Bull, Callaway, Christian Clark, Fleming, Franklin, Gar Hancock, Harden Heart, Hopkins, Jackson, Lawrence, Mercer Monroe, Montgomery Nelson, Scott, Spencer, Todd Woodford.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
343,"And one, uh, Unconfirmed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
344,"Um, after having, um, the last time that, that we were together, um, actually having Saturday when we werent, um, having just one of the only two times in the last several months where wed had zero deaths.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
345,"Speaker 2    00:37:06    We do have new deaths, but, but they are for three days especially, uh, really low.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
346,"And again, well have to look at tomorrow to see if its just reporting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
347,But today we are reporting three new deaths to Covid 19.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
348,"But lets remember, every death is tragic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
349,"It brings our total number to 394, uh, one of which is probable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
350,"The Lester Lab confirmed, but thats three new families and 394 families total that are still grieving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
351,"Uh, so well be turning our lights back on, uh, at the mansion, um, on that same front porch, because we show compassion there not anger, we show love there, not hate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
352,"Well turn this capital dome green, and I hope you all light up your houses, your homes, your places of business and your institutions to honor those that have been lost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
353,"Uh, todays deaths include a 72 year old female from Jefferson, an 85 year old female from Adair, and a 63 year old male from a breaking down the ethnicity and racial data on race for cases, um, uh, that are known.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
354,"Speaker 2    00:38:20    74.13% white, 14.61%, black or African American, 5.68% Asian, 5.4% multiracial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
355,"And then when you break down ethnicity, uh, 85.31% Hispanic, 14.69 per, Im sorry, I read that backwards, 84.31% non-Hispanic and 14.69% Hispanic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
356,"When you look at deaths, and well start in the ethnicity, its about 97% non-Hispanic and 3% Hispanic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
357,"And then on race, 77.8% white, 18.54%, black or African American, uh, just about 2% Asian and 1.7% multiracial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
358,"Um, and lets remember even that, you know, in the past, Ive, Ive talked about when we read the, the, the ages and the the genders and, and the counties, uh, of those that weve lost in saying theyre more than just numbers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
359,"So are these, so are these.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
360,And it shows things that we have not fixed in our society that have been broken for a long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
361,And my commitment coming out of this is to do everything I can to make it right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
362,"Speaker 2    00:39:37    Healthcare is a basic human right, and its time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
363,We treat it as such.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
364,"Looking at long-term care facilities, uh, again, we talked about how, I mean, last week we tested, um, uh, over 3000 individuals in long-term care facilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
365,"So we are going to see, uh, these numbers, uh, increase 54 new residents, 27 new staff, and three new deaths going back have, um, uh, have been added here in 26, uh, new facilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
366,"So now, if you were one of the people at that bar that we showed, if you were one of the people that knows that theres a virus out there, but you just didnt care, this doesnt spring up in these facilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
367,Somebody has to bring it in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
368,"And most everybody working at these facilities never bring it up, bring it in on their own.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
369,"Its somebody who has flaunted or even accidentally, um, become infected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
370,Speaker 2    00:40:37    It spreads it to them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
371,That brings it in here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
372,All of our actions matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
373,"Now, lets talk about testing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
374,Testing is a real positive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
375,"If you look at our testing locations for this week across Kentucky, uh, you will see something pretty amazing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
376,"Uh, you will see that we now have tests out there for everybody who wants, want everybody who wants one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
377,But you know what.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
378,We gotta have people that show up that want to get these tests if were gonna be safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
379,"Ill be very clear that the White House, federal health experts, state health experts, and your governor would tell you that if we dont test significant numbers of people and we dont do the tracing of their contacts, you cant open safely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
380,The White House says you shouldnt even open if you cant test a certain level and trace thats straight from the president and the vice president.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
381,"Speaker 2    00:41:28    Um, but a little, uh, few disappointing numbers, uh, that we are seeing in our testing this week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
382,Something we wanna fix.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
383,"I think its due to a really long weekend, but we can prove thats the case tomorrow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
384,"So when we look at our Kroger numbers for today of our drive through sites, theyre all down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
385,"Um, as of four, we only had 330 individuals go through, uh, the Louisville facility, though it is booked up for the rest of the week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
386,"Um, and we are excited about that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
387,So good job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
388,"Just make sure, uh, you show up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
389,"But in Bowling Green, only 206 thus far, uh, today, and as we look at the next three days, 84 total signed up on Wednesday, 39 on Thursday and 22 on Friday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
390,We have a major outbreak in Warren County that our testing can help us identify and control.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
391,"But you, youve gotta go in and youve gotta get tested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
392,"Speaker 2    00:42:22    So we need all our local leaders, we need everybody out there pushing people to get tested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
393,"None of this, we dont want testing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
394,So we dont know theres a problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
395,And our Warren County leaders havent done that though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
396,"Weve had some others that have declined, uh, testing sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
397,Now thats turning your back on your people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
398,We gotta know the level of our problem if were gonna protect the people that are out there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
399,And that means we have testing everywhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
400,So we make sure we can keep people safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
401,"Uh, Lexington, we had 282 as of four, uh, but then we need more signups on Wednesday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
402,"Almost, uh, uh, 150 left.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
403,"Uh, Thursday and Friday have almost 400 left.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
404,I know that Lexington and the surrounding area has been one of our best areas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
405,We need you to sign up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
406,You can sign up right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
407,"We put the, the sign up for the, for the Kroger, uh, testing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
408,Speaker 2    00:43:15    And then finally theres Henderson.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
409,"Now again, this is near an outbreak area and Davis County and Henderson has had a bunch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410,"But, uh, unless our numbers are wrong, as of for today, wed only had 24 people come through that site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
411,"Tomorrow we have 21 signed up and Thursday, seven folks, this is real.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
412,Its in this part of the state.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
413,We need you to take advantage of this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
414,This is about protecting your community.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
415,"So come on right now, go online, sign up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
416,"Listen, tomorrow, you can get in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
417,You can even get the hour that its gonna be done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
418,You will have no wait.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
419,You can get in right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
420,"Protect your family, protect your community.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
421,"If youre somebody who has gone back to work or is reopening a business, make sure youre not infecting people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
422,"Uh, this is the way to, to do it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
423,"All right, So we are in the Supreme Court chambers today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
424,Its bigger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
425,"Weve been, uh, able to open up, uh, 2, 2, 3, uh, a few more reporters than weve had.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
426,"I think we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, uh, that are here today because we could do it through social distancing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
427,"We have Karen Za, Phil Pendleton, Joe Sanka, Joe Ragusa, Lawrence Smith, uh, Katherine Collins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
428,And I just have a few additional questions here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
429,So well start on the left with Karen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
430,Speaker 7    00:44:32    Governor brought security before you said you felt pretty comfortable after this weekend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
431,"Do you want security where the Ryan bes man, or are you still feeling comfortable with how thats going.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
432,"Speaker 2    00:44:43    Well, I, uh, so the question is on security.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
433,"And I guess the question about security is people walking right past all the signs that say, this is where the public ends and walking up on somebody elses porch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
434,"And, you know, I wonder, I dont have to wonder too much about the individuals who did that, how they feel when people walk on their property and up to their porch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
435,"So that tells you, I think, what these people intended by their actions and how serious it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
436,"Uh, now we are reviewing security protocols about exactly how that happened.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
437,I believe most people in Kentucky would believe you shouldnt be able to walk through every barrier thats there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
438,"And we may have to look at additional security or, or the different structures around that mansion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
439,"Um, I hate that because people really enjoy it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
440,"But this is what happens, uh, when people dont care about the rest of us and, and do the wrong thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
441,"Speaker 2    00:45:41    So, uh, well be taking a look.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
442,"Well be going over, um, all, all of those protocols, listen, they dont scare me, but be standing there right on the other side of the window painter where my kids are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
443,And they knew it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
444,Thats why they did it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
445,"They thought that if they are not being, uh, and not getting their way, knowing that this states more united than ever before, theyd just use fear and terror.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
446,Its not gonna work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
447,Alright.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
448,"Um, what are my familys thoughts and what did I think Monday about the caravan of support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
449,I appreciated it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
450,It didnt take people getting on Facebook and riling each other up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
451,It didnt take elected officials out there throwing red meat at folks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
452,It was just the goodness inside of all of us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
453,"Uh, I know, I know that we are a good and compassionate and caring people, and my family knows that too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
454,But I will tell you that Britney really appreciated it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
455,And I think so did I.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
456,It was pretty special.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
457,"And weve seen, uh, we were able to at least wave to one family, and weve already seen em post about it to today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
458,So its a caring community.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
459,"I dont regret my decision to move my family here, Joe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
460,"Speaker 7    00:46:56    Uh, I, I never that  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
461,"Speaker 2    00:46:57    Question, but, okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
462,Speaker 7    00:46:59    So a lot of people were concerned that the large group of guns able to get all the to the there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
463,But  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
464,"Speaker 2    00:47:16    The question, and I wanna make sure Im quoting you instead of people say that this is me, is especially with an armed group like that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
465,"And I wonder what this group would think of someone else who was armed, walked up on their patio, um, but, but walking past all of the signs and the rest, uh, up to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
466,"Um, again, what do I think about security.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
467,"I think that they should expect a very different, uh, response the next time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
468,"And I hope everybody, uh, would expect that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
469,"Um, yeah, this is something that we shouldnt see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
470,"Uh, and its something that, uh, I hope everybody is against and in condemnation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
471,"I hope that they dont first start by saying, Well, I disagree with the governor and then Im gonna do this or that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
472,But its wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
473,"Oh, just wrong is wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
474,"I mean, when you call out wrong and you, you mely mouth it for a couple sentences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
475,"Speaker 2    00:48:08    And I hope in other instances when its not me, and I do wanna say this, that Ive done it, I hope I have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
476,"Um, and if I havent, I will do better, uh, the next time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
477,"And certainly, um, I know that the, the hanging and effigy thing they did, and listen, it had my face on it, but it was intended to sp send a message to a different audience, one that knows a pain from that much deeper than I ever will.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
478,And its just wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
479,"No other sentences to explain it, just wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
480,"All right, other Joe,  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
481,"Speaker 7    00:48:40    Um, I know you mentioned that governors  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
482,"Speaker 2    00:48:48    Not moving outta the governors mansion, not bend into terror not letting a couple of jerks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
483,And thats about as far as Ive said it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
484,I havent bleeped once in any of these.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
485,"Im not gonna be bleeped today, but Im not gonna let a bunch of jerks change the way that were living our life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
486,"Yeah, Im gonna look at the safety protocols around my kids, uh, but Im not gonna let, um, uh, folks who, who would resort to this, uh, try to change the way that were going about this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
487,"I, again, weve never seen more people together in life, and Ive never had something more important than Im doing now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
488,I knew gut being governor would be probably the most important role that I would ever play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
489,"But leading a state through a pandemic that can take so many lives, um, thats gonna be the most important thing I ever do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
490,Speaker 2    00:49:36    And Im not gonna let them impact how I go about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
491,"Richmond, Jim opened, uh, Richmond.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
492,"Jim reopened his gym on Monday, a week earlier in the state is allowing, he believes Jims are essential.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
493,Most of his clients are depressed and have gained weight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
494,I take it thats from him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
495,"Um, he will offer personal training and group classes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
496,"Oh, group classes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
497,"Well, I mean, thats a way sweating in, in a small area that Covid os certainly going to spread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
498,"Uh, he says he has a plan for sanitation and social distancing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
499,Is it okay or is it too soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
500,You know what.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
501,We all gotta follow the rules.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
502,"Im sure he will hear from some people, No, you gotta wait until the time everybody else has, everybody else is trying to do it right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
503,Probably every other gym owner thinks theyre having to wait too long.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
504,And thats okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
505,"But to simply just say, Im not gonna follow any of those rules, it doesnt just put your clients at risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
506,"Uh, its unfair to everybody else thats following the rules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
507,"Listen to this gym owner, uh, with every other gym owner out there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
508,Youre not special.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
509,"Listen, everybodys in this together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
510,Were all trying to do the right things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
511,"We can disagree on the timing of it, but everybody should have to follow their own, their own rules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
512,"You shouldnt get one leg up, uh, on your competitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
513,"Katherine,  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
514,"Speaker 7    00:50:52    Uh, some elected officials have called for the person, people responsible for the, to be charged with the crime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
515,Do you agree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
516,"Speaker 2    00:51:00    Uh, so the question is, some elected officials have called for, uh, the folks that, um, that, that did the hanging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
517,"Uh, I dont quite know what to call it cuz it was me, my face at least on something.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
518,"But I was tall and skinny, um, to be charged with a, with a crime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
519,"Im gonna leave that, uh, two, um, those prosecutors and those investigators, I was one before this job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
520,"Uh, I would hope to hear, uh, from those in those, uh, jobs, uh, about, uh, about what they believe, but more so than the elected officials calling for this or that, I do think that we still need to have some responsibility from the multiple state representatives and a state senator that sat in front of the exact same group and tried to fire them up and anger them just months before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
521,What do you thinks gonna happen talking to that group.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
522,"Like we all have responsibility as leaders when we go in front of these groups and, you know, people could go too far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
523,"You gotta, you, you gotta do the right thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
524,"I mean, thats a little bit of what leadership is about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
525,And you dont just get to try to get out there and gain support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
526,I think on Sunday they had two candidates that had set up tents.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
527,Wow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
528,Speaker 2    00:52:17    All right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
529,"Uh, long term care facility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
530,"I think we answered, uh, that one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
531,"Uh, do the numbers of hospitalizations reported every day include patients in the ICU or the number separate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
532,"And Kelly, I know we have the ICU numbers that are reported separately, but are they also in the hospitalized number  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
533,Speaker 7    00:52:36    A  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
534,Speaker 2    00:52:37    Set.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
535,All right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
536,"Well get an answer to that, Lawrence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
537,Speaker 7    00:52:48    Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
538,And then this action.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
539,"Speaker 2    00:52:50    Well, Lawrence, I think you know who the people are that were at the rally that fired these people up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
540,And I think that they do too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
541,Im not gonna sit here and call out peoples names in front of those that are watching.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
542,Thats not who I want to be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
543,"Uh, but I certainly think, uh, that they bear responsibility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
544,And I dont think this is a back and forth with the media asking this side and that side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
545,"Do they, I mean, dont they.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
546,"Listen, weve seen one of the, I dont know if its one of the most bios in, in on the capital grounds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
547,"I know its, its a little personal to me, right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
548,"Because Im the governor at the time and, and Im who they were trying to do it to and their family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
549,"But isnt this a time when, you know, theyre in this side and that side, Theyre just the facts and theres just right and wrong, Phil,  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
550,Speaker 7    00:53:33    Some of the on  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
551,"Speaker 2    00:53:43    Right,  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
552,Speaker 7    00:53:45    It wouldve been better to get the numbers out those days as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
553,"Speaker 2    00:53:50    So Phils question is, um, would it have been better since other states did it to give out numbers on Sunday and Monday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
554,"Uh, and most of our labs were closed both of those days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
555,"Um, and my concern was if wed come in here, and I told you there were 30 new positive cases because the tests which were done today, but, but for that day hadnt come in, it wouldve presented a, a false picture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
556,"And I think people needed a little bit of a break, uh, which is helpful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
557,"And, and while we wont do these every three days, it does give you a better picture in many ways of where it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
558,Though I will say tomorrows numbers may change the way we feel about these.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
559,"And so one of the things, and I think most of the report for, for those at home, most of the reporters here who have been following this can kind of see how, um, the numbers are a little bit lower at the beginning of the week, and Tuesday or Wednesday are up because more of them have come in and then they kind of come back down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
560,"And so were looking at what averages, uh, are best there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
561,"I know one of the online tools, which is the COVID 19 done backwards, is actually has a chart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
562,"And when you look at it by our one week average, its actually showing us, uh, on the decline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
563,"So I dont think its just us that believe that were headed in that, uh, direction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
564,"All right, Karen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
565,"Speaker 7    00:55:05    Oh, todays about acts just starting to go out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
566,So were not sure that how we needed he does possibly another package.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
567,Speaker 2    00:55:26    So the question is Senator McConnell today saying there might be another CARES Act.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
568,"Uh, right now, the way this CARES Act is written in state government, we can only use it for very limited purposes, which means it can help us a little, but not a lot in the budget situation were facing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
569,"And contrary to another senator, that is not of my making, that is Covid 19.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
570,"And sure, if you ignore a Worldwide Health Pandemic, you can blame any an anybody for, for anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
571,"Um, but, uh, we are facing the same thing that everybody else, uh, in this country is facing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
572,"Every state is facing, and we need direct financial assistance from the federal government, just like in the Great Recession.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
573,"No red states, no blue states.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
574,This isnt bail and anybody out for decisions made in the past.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
575,"It is directly what were seeing related, uh, to Covid 19.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
576,"Speaker 2    00:56:13    Um, I believe Senator McConnell talked about liability protections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
577,I need to know what they are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
578,"What we cant do is let a business come back online and ignore all of the CDC rules and say, Hey, were immune.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
579,"Because sadly, theres some out there they would do or allow terrible things to happen to people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
580,"Now, most businesses wouldnt, they do the right thing no matter what.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
581,"And so if they wanna have a conversation about if we do it all right and something happens, okay, you know, thats a conversation we can have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
582,"Maybe it would encourage people, uh, to have the best practices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
583,"But weve, you know, liability reform is one of those words they throw out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
584,And it could mean a thousand different things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
585,"And being a reformed lawyer, I know what a few of them mean.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
586,"And lets, lets do, lets do this, Joe first and then second.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
587,"Speaker 7    00:56:55    Um, I know we anticipate place on,  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
588,"Speaker 2    00:57:03    Uh, uh, right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

590,But I do wanna say to those out there that think restrictions are unlimited.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
591,"You know, when when, when the president say, comes into Kentucky to give a speech, you dont get to protest right next to em.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
592,"And hopefully none of those who have opposed restrictions would would think that what you can always do is ascribe a safe place and time that allows people to get, um, what they need to say out, but at the same time, uh, doesnt ultimately intrude on other peoples rights, uh, or prevent business from being done.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

598,Thats twice now that they didnt believe things that Ive stood up here and said to the people of Kentucky day after day after day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

606,"Speaker 2    00:58:34    I think thats a technical question well have to get, uh, a technical answer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
607,"Uh, for, um, I believe that the pandemic, uh, unemployment has some very specific qualifications on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
608,"Uh, I think some of it is if you are over the age group and youre suffering or youre suffering from certain conditions, then yes, you probably would call.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
609,"In other words, if you have major heart disease, you shouldnt be back, you know, in a daycare right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
610,And we ought to understand that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
611,"Now, there are some other reasons that you probably couldnt not otherwise go back for, uh, but I think its important that we view them in, in the most reasonable light, positive, uh, possible Catherine  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
612,"Speaker 7    00:59:21    That mean by the state, or would that mean local  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
613,Speaker 2    00:59:23    Department.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
614,I believe when restaurants or bars serving food.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
615,"And what we saw, I think was somebody taking advantage of, of having a food license.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
616,"Uh, yes, I believe that that one has already seen, uh, local inspectors and a scene, state inspectors, you cant flaunt, uh, the rules that everybody else is following and put people at risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
617,"Lawrence,  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

621,"Uh, you know, I think its one thing for people to say they can open safely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
622,Its another thing for them to be able to do it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
623,"And at the end of the day, people who are going arent just going to say those that own a facility say they can open it safely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
624,Theyve got the economic interest to do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
625,Theyre gonna expect my administration to weigh in on whether its safe or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
626,"And were gonna make sure, uh, before we come out and say that people can or, or should do something that it is indeed safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
627,What they wanted is a conversation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

643,"Uh, we still have to satisfy federal law and the federal government is now starting to say to states, Youre doing this too fast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
644,So were trying to help as many people as we can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
